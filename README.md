If still can't trust. You could compile this python programe on your own. first install pynput from cmd. by typing pip install pynput or python -m pip install pynput. then follow the steps

Step 1 - open command prompt



Step 2 - type "pip install pyinstaller" if it doesn't work type "python -m pip install pyinstaller"
          what it does that it will compile python program and convert it to .exe file


          
Step 3 - Type "cd Directory of the file"




Step 4 - Type "python -m PyInstaller --onefile --noconsole autoclicker.py"
